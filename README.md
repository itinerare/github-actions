Common workflows for personal projects/for ease of re-use. They're geared toward Laravel projects, naturally, though this is a common resource for my use and may contain whatsoever suits my needs.

Some notes:
- You're welcome to make use of the workflows contained here, but note that I maintain these primarily for my use/for projects I personally maintain; if your needs diverge from those of the aforementioned projects, I recommend you set up similar for yourself rather than submit a PR here (barring errors, of course).
- Linting and rebuilding mix/vite assets require actions to have write access on the repository they're being used in; the workflows themselves do have this requirement listed on them as well.
